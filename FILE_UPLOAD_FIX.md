## File Upload Test Results

### âœ… Fixed Issues:

1. **Removed onclick attribute** from upload area div
2. **Eliminated label element** that was causing duplicate file dialogs  
3. **Hidden file input** completely (display: none)
4. **Simplified click handling** with single event listener
5. **Added event prevention** for buttons and form elements
6. **Implemented file change throttling** to prevent multiple triggers

### ðŸŽ¯ How it works now:

- **Single click** on upload area â†’ Opens file dialog ONCE
- **Select file** â†’ Shows file info, no additional dialogs
- **Click upload button** â†’ Processes upload, no file dialogs
- **After upload** â†’ Clean state, no unwanted dialogs

### âš¡ Key Changes:

```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
<div onclick="document.getElementById('image').click()">
<label for="image">Choose File</label>

// NEW (clean):
<div id="upload-area">
<input style="display: none;">
// + controlled event handling
```

The file dialog should now only open when you explicitly click in the upload area, and never open multiple times or after uploads.
